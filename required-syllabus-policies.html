    <div class="policy_section" id="academic_integrity">
        <h3>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY</h3>
        <p>Academic dishonesty is not limited to simply cheating on an exam or assignment. The following is quoted directly from the
            "PSU Faculty Senate Policies for Students" regarding academic integrity and academic dishonesty: "Academic integrity is
            the pursuit of scholarly activity free from fraud and deception and is an educational objective of this institution. Academic dishonesty includes,
            but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarizing, fabricating of information or citations, facilitating acts of academic dishonesty by others, having
            unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used without informing the instructor, or tampering
            with the academic work of other students."
        </p>
        <p>All University and Penn State Harrisburg policies regarding academic integrity/academic dishonesty apply to this course and the students enrolled in this
            course. Refer to the following URL for further details on the academic integrity policy of Penn State Harrisburg:
            <a href="http://harrisburg.psu.edu/academics/academic-guidelines-and-policies">http://harrisburg.psu.edu/academics/academic-guidelines-and-policies</a>.
            Each student in this course is expected to work entirely on her/his own while taking any exam, to complete assignments on her/his own effort without
            the assistance of others unless directed otherwise by the instructor, and to abide by University and Penn State Harrisburg policies about academic
            integrity and academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty can result in an assignment of "F" or "XF" as the final grade for the student. (Note:
            Indicate if you plan to use Turnitin (<a href="http://turnitin.psu.edu/">http://turnitin.psu.edu/</a>) as a plagiarism detection tool.)

        <h3>DISABILITY ACCESS</h3>
        <p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational programs. Every Penn State campus has a Student DisAbility Resources office.
            Student DisAbility Resources at Penn State Harrisburg is located in SEC 205. The Disability Services Coordinator, Alan Babcock, can be reached via email at
            aub15@psu.edu or phone 717-948-6025.

        <p>To receive consideration for accommodations, you must contact Student DisAbility Resources (SDR), participate in an intake interview, provide documentation of
            your disability, and complete a Self-Assessment. Additional information is available on the Disability Services website
            (<a href="http://harrisburg.psu.edu/disability-services">http://harrisburg.psu.edu/disability-services</a>). If the documentation supports requests for reasonable accommodations,
            SDR will provide you with an accommodations letter, which you will give to your professors. You will receive accommodations after you give your accommodations
            letters to your professors. You should share your accommodations letters with your professors as early in the semester as possible. Professors do not provide
            accommodations retroactively.

    <h3>MANDATED REPORTING</h3>
        <p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting responsibility
            related to my role as an educator. It is my goal that you feel able to share information related to your life experiences in classroom discussions, in your
            written work, and in our one-on-one meetings. I will seek to keep information you share private to the greatest extent possible. However, per University
            policy AD85 (<a href="https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad85">https://policy.psu.edu/policies/ad85</a>), I am required to share information regarding sexual
            misconduct or information about a crime with the University including incidents of sex-based discrimination and harassment (discrimination, harassment,
            sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, dating violence, domestic violence, stalking, and retaliation). While faculty are ethically bound to report any
            information as it relates to University policy, we are also a resource and want to be sure you are aware of the services available to you.
